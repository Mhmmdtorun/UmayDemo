# About Game Name;
Umay is the most important sacred asset in Turkish mythology, symbol of birth and fertility.Godliness is the most important religious entity that comes after God in faith. In ancient Turkish inscriptions occasionally only his name goes with God. The names of other religious beings do not pass in the old inscriptions. Umay, when a child is born, it comes down to it and drove a drop of milk from the lake in the sky to the lips of the child, thus giving him a soul, protecting the mother and child for 3 days. The smile of the child means that Umay is with the child. If Umay leaves a long-term child, the child becomes sick. It is believed that Umay is the goddess of the earth which is the counterpart in the middle Asian mythology "Ece". It is called by the people of Hakas as Imay Ece and portrayed as a delicate woman with white hair and is believed to observe the human being through a pink cloud. It is known by the name Ayisit.
